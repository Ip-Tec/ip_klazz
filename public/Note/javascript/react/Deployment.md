# Building for Production & Deployment

Congratulations! You’ve built some amazing things. Today, we’ll learn how to share your React app with the world.

## 1. The Build Process

The code you write (`.jsx`) cannot be read by browsers directly. We need to "build" it into clean HTML, CSS, and JS.

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder. This folder contains the only files you actually need to upload to a server.

## 2. Deployment to Vercel

Vercel is the easiest place to host React apps.

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect your GitHub account to Vercel.
3. Select your project and click "Deploy".

## Final Review

You’ve mastered:

- JSX & Components
- State & Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- Navigation with React Router
- Data Fetching & Forms

## What's Next?

Now that you know the fundamentals of React, you can explore:

- **State Management Libraries** (Redux, Zustand)
- **CSS-in-JS** (Styled Components, Tailwind)
- **Frameworks** (Next.js)
