# Capstone Project: Collaborative Task Manager

For your final project, you’ll build a **Collab Task Manager**. This project combines everything: State, Props, Hooks, Forms, and Lists.

## Project Features:

1. **Task List**: Display a list of tasks that can be filtered (All, Active, Completed).
2. **Add/Delete**: Users can add new tasks and delete existing ones.
3. **Persistence**: Use `useEffect` and `localStorage` to save your tasks so they stay there after a page refresh!
4. **Multiple Users**: Use the Context API to show a "Welcome, [Username]" message at the top.

## Technical Challenge:

Try to make your tasks "editable" by clicking on their text!

## Homework:

Start building your Capstone! Take your time to structure your components logically.
