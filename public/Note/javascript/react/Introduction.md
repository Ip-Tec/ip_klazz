# Intro to React & Environment Setup

Welcome to the world of building user interfaces! React is a popular JavaScript library for building single-page applications (SPAs) that are fast, interactive, and easy to maintain.

## What is React?

React was created by Facebook and is based on **Components**. Think of components as LEGO blocks that you use to build your website.

## Why use React?

- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Virtual DOM**: React is extremely fast because it only updates the parts of the page that actually change.

## Environment Setup

The easiest way to start a new React project is using **Vite**.

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# Move into the folder
cd my-react-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Homework:

1. Install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Create your first React project using Vite.
3. Open the project in VS Code and look at the `src` folder.
