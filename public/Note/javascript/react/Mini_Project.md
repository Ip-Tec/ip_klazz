# Mini Project: Personal Portfolio

Today you will build your own **Personal Portfolio** website using React! This is a great way to showcase what you've learned to potential employers.

## Requirements:

1. **Routing**: Use `react-router-dom` to create "Home", "About", and "Projects" pages.
2. **Components**: Build a reusable `ProjectCard` component to show off your work.
3. **State**: Add a "Theme Toggle" (Dark/Light mode) using `useState` or the Context API.
4. **Data**: Use an array of objects to store your project details and `.map()` through them.

## Tips:

- Use a CSS file or a library like Tailwind (if you know it) to make it look professional.
- Focus on a clean, simple design.

## Homework:
