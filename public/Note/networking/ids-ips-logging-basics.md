# IDS/IPS and Logging Basics

You can't defend against threats you can't see. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and robust logging are your eyes and ears on the network. They are critical components of a defense-in-depth security strategy.

## What is an IDS?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. An IDS is a passive device; it only detects and alerts. It does not take any action to stop the malicious activity.

### Types of IDS

- **Network-based IDS (NIDS):** Deployed at a strategic point in the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices. It analyzes network traffic for suspicious patterns.
- **Host-based IDS (HIDS):** Runs on an individual host or device. It monitors the system's files, processes, and network traffic for signs of an intrusion.

### Detection Methods

- **Signature-based Detection:** The IDS has a database of known attack "signatures." It compares network traffic to these signatures to identify attacks. This is effective against known threats but cannot detect new attacks.
- **Anomaly-based Detection:** The IDS first builds a baseline of normal network behavior. It then monitors traffic for any deviation from this baseline. This can detect new attacks but may also generate false positives.

## What is an IPS?

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an active device that builds on IDS technology. Like an IDS, it monitors for malicious activity, but it can also take action to block or prevent the attack. For example, an IPS can drop malicious packets, block traffic from a specific IP address, or reset a connection.

An IPS is deployed "in-line," meaning that all traffic must pass through it. This allows it to block attacks in real-time.

## IDS vs. IPS

| Feature | IDS (Intrusion Detection System) | IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mode** | Passive (out-of-band) | Active (in-line) |
| **Action**| Detects and alerts | Prevents and blocks |
| **Risk** | If it fails, you lose visibility. | If it fails, it can block legitimate traffic. |

Popular open-source IDS/IPS tools include **Snort** and **Suricata**.

## The Importance of Logging

Logging is the process of recording events that happen in your systems and network. Without logs, it is nearly impossible to investigate a security incident or troubleshoot a problem.

### What to Log

You should log as much as is practical, but here are some essential sources:

- **Firewall Logs:** Shows which traffic is being allowed and denied.
- **Operating System Logs:** Includes authentication events (logins, failed logins), system errors, and other important events.
- **Application Logs:** Logs from your web server, database, and other applications.
- **IDS/IPS Logs:** Alerts generated by your intrusion detection and prevention systems.

### Centralized Logging

Managing logs from many different devices can be challenging. A centralized logging solution can help. This involves sending all of your logs to a central server where they can be stored, searched, and analyzed.

A common centralized logging stack is the **ELK Stack**:

- **Elasticsearch:** A powerful search and analytics engine.
- **Logstash:** A data processing pipeline that can collect, parse, and enrich logs.
- **Kibana:** A visualization tool that allows you to create dashboards and explore your data.

Another popular choice is **Graylog**.

### Log Analysis

Simply collecting logs is not enough. You need to analyze them to find evidence of malicious activity. This can be done manually, but it is often more effective to use a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system. A SIEM can correlate events from different sources, identify patterns, and generate alerts.

## Summary

IDS/IPS and logging are essential for network visibility and security. An IDS/IPS can help you detect and block attacks in real-time, while logs provide the information you need to investigate incidents and improve your defenses.
