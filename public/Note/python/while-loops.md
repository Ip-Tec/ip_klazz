# While Loops

While loops allow you to repeat code as long as a condition is true. They're essential for creating programs that need to perform repetitive tasks until a specific condition is met.

## Basic While Loop

### Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # Code to repeat
    statement1
    statement2
```

The loop continues while the condition is 'True' and stops when it becomes 'False'.

### Simple Examples

```python
# Count from 1 to 5
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Countdown
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1
print("Blast off!")

# Sum numbers
total = 0
number = 1
while number <= 10:
    total += number
    number += 1
print(f"Sum: {total}")
```

---

## Loop Conditions

The condition is checked before each iteration.

```python
# Loop until user enters "quit"
command = ""
while command != "quit":
    command = input("Enter command (quit to exit): ")
    print(f"You entered: {command}")

# Loop until valid input
age = -1
while age < 0 or age > 120:
    age = int(input("Enter age (0-120): "))

# Loop while balance is positive
balance = 100
while balance > 0:
    withdrawal = int(input("Withdrawal amount: "))
    balance -= withdrawal
    print(f"Balance: ${balance}")
```

---

## Infinite Loops

A loop that never ends because the condition never becomes false.

### Accidental Infinite Loops

```python
# Wrong - infinite loop (forgot to update count)
# count = 1
# while count <= 5:
#     print(count)
#     # Missing: count += 1

# Wrong - condition always true
# while True:
#     print("This will run forever!")
```

### Intentional Infinite Loops

```python
# Intentional infinite loop with break
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
    if user_input == "quit":
        break
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")

# Main game loop
while True:
    choice = input("1. Play 2. Quit: ")
    if choice == "2":
        break
    print("Playing game...")
```

---

## Loop Control Statements

### break - Exit Loop Early

```python
# Break out of loop
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    if count == 5:
        break  # Exit loop when count is 5
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Find first even number
number = 1
while True:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"First even: {number}")
        break
    number += 1

# Search in list
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11]
target = 10
index = 0
while index < len(numbers):
    if numbers[index] == target:
        print(f"Found {target} at index {index}")
        break
    index += 1
```

### continue - Skip to Next Iteration

```python
# Skip odd numbers
count = 0
while count < 10:
    count += 1
    if count % 2 != 0:
        continue  # Skip odd numbers
    print(count)

# Skip invalid input
while True:
    value = input("Enter positive number (0 to quit): ")
    number = int(value)
    if number == 0:
        break
    if number < 0:
        print("Invalid! Must be positive")
        continue  # Skip to next iteration
    print(f"You entered: {number}")
```

---

## Common While Loop Patterns

### Counter Pattern

```python
# Count up
counter = 1
while counter <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {counter}")
    counter += 1

# Count down
counter = 5
while counter > 0:
    print(f"Count: {counter}")
    counter -= 1
```

### Accumulator Pattern

```python
# Sum accumulator
total = 0
number = 1
while number <= 5:
    total += number
    number += 1
print(f"Sum: {total}")

# Product accumulator
product = 1
number = 1
while number <= 5:
    product *= number
    number += 1
print(f"Product: {product}")
```

### Sentinel Pattern

```python
# Loop until sentinel value
total = 0
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter number (-1 to stop): "))
    if number == -1:
        break
    total += number
print(f"Total: {total}")

# Process input until empty
while True:
    text = input("Enter text (empty to stop): ")
    if not text:
        break
    print(f"You entered: {text}")
```

### Validation Pattern

```python
# Validate input
password = ""
while len(password) < 8:
    password = input("Enter password (8+ chars): ")
    if len(password) < 8:
        print("Too short!")

# Validate range
age = -1
while not (0 <= age <= 120):
    age = int(input("Enter age (0-120): "))
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        print("Invalid age!")
```

---

## Nested While Loops

```python
# Multiplication table
row = 1
while row <= 3:
    col = 1
    while col <= 3:
        print(f"{row} Ã— {col} = {row * col}")
        col += 1
    row += 1

# Pattern printing
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end="")
        j += 1
    print()  # New line
    i += 1
```

---

## While with else

The 'else' block executes when the loop completes normally (not via 'break').

```python
# Search with else
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 6
index = 0
while index < len(numbers):
    if numbers[index] == target:
        print(f"Found {target}")
        break
    index += 1
else:
    print(f"{target} not found")

# Countdown with else
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
else:
    print("Countdown complete!")
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Menu System

```python
while True:
    print("\n=== MENU ===")
    print("1. Option 1")
    print("2. Option 2")
    print("3. Exit")
    
    choice = input("Choose: ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        print("Option 1 selected")
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Option 2 selected")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")
```

### Guessing Game

```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 10)
attempts = 0

while True:
    attempts += 1
    guess = int(input("Guess (1-10): "))
    
    if guess == secret:
        print(f"Correct! Took {attempts} attempts")
        break
    elif guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")
```

### Password System

```python
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3
attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret123"

while attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if password == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    attempts += 1
    remaining = MAX_ATTEMPTS - attempts
    print(f"Wrong! {remaining} attempts left")
else:
    print("Account locked!")
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Update Loop Variable

```python
# Wrong - infinite loop
# count = 1
# while count <= 5:
#     print(count)
#     # Forgot: count += 1

# Correct
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Mistake 2: Off-by-One Errors

```python
# Wrong - runs 11 times (0-10)
count = 0
while count <= 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Correct - runs 10 times (0-9)
count = 0
while count < 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Condition

```python
# Wrong - never runs
count = 10
while count < 5:
    print(count)

# Correct
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
